-- Recursion schemes --
-----------------------

-- Recursion schemes are design idioms for traversing through recursive data types.
-- They were brought into light by the paper of Meijer et. al "Functional programming
-- with bananas, lenses, envelopes and barbed wire." They connect recursion schemes to
-- constructs in category theory, bringing a theoretical framework for recursive data.
